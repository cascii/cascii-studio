.cascii filetype
- zipped text frames.
- color
- font
- player
- type


don't create project if not all files are saved/converted
- converting progress bar

cascii dep: autodetect to match framerate. i suspect that generating more frames than in the source files causes
Speed disparity

features
- auto load frames
- frames buffer
- load frames in parallel

Use side webviews to display frames and mp4 in windows
println should only happen if debug mode on in settings

Focus frame loading on selected frames

bugs:
- should not auto switch to other frames that just finished loading
- post treatment for frames: select background color and font color as an alternative to black and white
